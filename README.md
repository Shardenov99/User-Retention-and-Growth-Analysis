## 4.  Summary
- **Revenue growth is slowing** because the customer base is shifting toward low-value, infrequent buyers.  
- **New users struggle to become loyal, high-value customers**, limiting long-term revenue potential.  
- **Loyal, profitable customers are a minority**, and many previously active users have lapsed.
